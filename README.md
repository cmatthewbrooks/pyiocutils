#pyiocutils

A collection of utilities for use in Python scripts related to
working with "indicators of compromise" (IOCs). 

+ ioc.py - a set of static methods grouped under the "Ioc" class to check and handle indicators
+ iocfile.py - a class to instantiate to parse a plain-text file of IOCs
+ icargs.py - a static method to handle IOC arguments

Note: this is not a reference to Mandiant's IOC [XML-based file format](https://github.com/fireeye/iocs). This
is more a reference to individual domain or ip strings as well as text files containings lists of these
indicators. You know - the shit with which analysts actually work.

## Usage

Basic usage examples were created using [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/). If something is
still unclear, file an issue so I can make this package as easy-to-use as possible.
